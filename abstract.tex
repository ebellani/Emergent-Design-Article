\begin{abstract}
    Our current society is exponentially increasing its dependency on technology
    and science, and this dependence is likely to get deeper in the close
    future. The current educational system is broken even for the needs of past
    decades, and it is a bad joke to consider it satisfactory for our current
    and future needs. This leads to a dangerous situation where a society will
    have a base that very few of its members comprehend.

    The educational proposal that I outline here leverages current technologies
    to create the condition where people can have access to top notch knowledge
    and technologies, so that a more democratic and efficient pedagogical
    approach can emerge, one that is more encompassing and that allows for much
    more personal control over the process.
