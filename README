This is an article about a new higher education system that that is designed
with an emergent design approach. It draws a lot from the works of Seymour Papert
and David Cavallo.

Here is a copy of the abstract

    This paper proposes a model of higher education that uses emer-
gence and constructionism as the guiding design principles and takes
the current computational technologies and networks as the techno-
logical base to distribute and generate information and knowledge.

    It also assumes and tries to make the point that the people of the
present and near future will grown up with access to computers and
their potential, and will take them for granted.
