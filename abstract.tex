\begin{abstract}
    This paper proposes a model of higher education that uses emergence and
    constructionism as the guiding design principles and takes the current
    computational technologies and networks as the technological base to
    distribute and generate information and knowledge. 

    It also assumes and tries to make the point that the people of the present
    and near future will grown up with access to computers and their potential,
    and will take them for granted.
